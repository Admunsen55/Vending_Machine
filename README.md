Vending Machine Simulation

Overview:
This project simulates a vending machine using VHDL. The vending machine has three coin inputs (1 RON, 5 RON, and 10 RON), buttons to request products, a button to request change, and a reset button. It displays the accumulated sum of inserted coins and can dispense two different products. Additionally, it can give change in case the user requests it. The design is based on the concept of Finite State Machine.
